# ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Automation

An end‑to‑end **CI/CD pipeline** that takes code from commit → tested → container image → deployed to a server environment.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- No manual SSH & “git pull on server” deployments.  
- Every change to `main` should:
  1. Run tests & linting  
  2. Build a Docker image  
  3. Push image to a registry  
  4. Deploy / restart the app container on a target host

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Example)

- **CI**: GitHub Actions (ya Jenkins)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Registry**: Docker Hub / GHCR
- **App Host**: Linux VM (Nginx reverse proxy + Docker)
- **Code**: Any web app (Node/Python/…); focus is on pipeline
